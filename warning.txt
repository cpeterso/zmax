                               IMPORTANT NOTICE

         0.01 is an INTRODUCTION version of Zmax. It may not be stable
         and  it may have bugs although it appears to work just  fine.
         0.01  has  been released to find out if there  are  any  bugs
         lurking around.

         Keep  an  eye open for the offical 1.00 release  sometime  in
         Sept  1990. Rolling your own driver may not be in  your  best
         interests until the offical 1.00 release.
